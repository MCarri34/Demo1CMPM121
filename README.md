## Peer-Inspired UI Improvements

This project includes two user interface improvements that were based on specific peer designs. Code comments crediting each peer are included in both main.ts and style.css.

### Clicker Button Animation (Inspired by Noah) [Noah's Github Repo](https://github.com/Noah2271/cmpm-121-incremental-nbilledo)

The breathing animation and glow effect applied to the main click button were based on Noah’s design choices. This helps bring more attention to the primary game action.

Specific links are included in source code comments where the changes were implemented.

### Upgrade Card Layout (Inspired by Neila) [Neila's Github Repo](https://github.com/BellaTheAlien/cmpm-121-D1-NeilaMiranda/tree/main)

The upgrade elements were redesigned using a centered card layout with spacing and hover interactions. This makes the shop easier to read and interact with. The inspiration for this came from Neila’s UI approach.
